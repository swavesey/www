# swavesey.app

A website dedicated to the services Swavesey has to offer.  
The collection is open source, so, if you see something that doesn't look right, either let us know or fix it yourself.
The aim is to bring our the village into the modern age, with a website that's fast, sleek, accessible, and can even be downloaded like an app to work offline on your phones (Progressive Web App).  
To begin with, the websites will be simple, and will offer more complex feature as the project develops.
